<br>

<h3>How to Prepare for a Diamond Painting.</h3>
<p>-Get a diamond painting kit.<br>
-Prepare pen with wax by pressing it through the wax (after peeling back the plastic).<br>
-Cut sealed diamond bags open and put the diamonds into little Ziploc bags or storage boxes, but keep track of the diamond numbers.<br>
-Peel the plastic off the mat with the pattern on it.</p>

<h3>How to Start a Diamond Painting.</h3>
<p>-Use the pen to pick up a single diamond by pressing it on the raised side of the diamond.<br> 
-Place the diamond on the sticky mat on a spot that matches the color code.<br>
-Repeat until all the labeled spots are covered.<br>
-When you finish the painting, it is smart to put a sealant on it.</p>
